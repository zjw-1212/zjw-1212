- 👋 Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Jingwen, from Data Science and Big Data Technology (hate super long professional name)
- 👀 In daily life, I prefer to play basketball, listen to music, and all kinds of sports, at the same time I also like to make a lot of friends, hope to do a lot of interesting things together
- 🌱 During these years in college, I have learned a lot of professional knowledge. For example: various programming languages, such as c, python. I also learned some tools about big data processing, such as spark and hdfs, which I am more interested in and familiar with. In short, we are still in a state where theory is greater than practice. I hope I can learn more this semester and increase the amount of my code
- 💞️ For me, I am more interested in data visualization and data preprocessing. I hope I can learn more about this aspect.
- 📫 In the future, I still plan to study hard and take the entrance exam for graduate school. I hope I can learn more knowledge related to my major and improve my ability. Because now their ability to go out may not find a little job, I hope to learn more things slowly replaced by ai
