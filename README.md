# - 👋 Hello everyone, I'm 张静雯, from 数据科学与大数据技术 (hate super long professional name)😒
## - hobby🤩❤️: 
In daily life, I prefer to play basketball, listen to music, and all kinds of sports, at the same time I also like to make a lot of friends, hope to do a lot of interesting things together😁
## - grow🌱: 
During these years in college, I have learned a lot of professional knowledge. For example: various programming languages, such as c, python. I also learned some tools about big data processing, such as spark and hdfs, which I am more interested in and familiar with. In short, we are still in a state where theory is greater than practice. I hope I can learn more this semester and increase the amount of my code🤗🤩🤤
## - 💞love:
For me, I am more interested in data visualization and data preprocessing. I hope I can learn more about this aspect.
## - 👩‍🎓future:
In the future, I still plan to study hard and take the entrance exam for graduate school. I hope I can learn more knowledge related to my major and improve my ability. Because now their ability to go out may not find a little job, I hope to learn more things slowly replaced by ai😭😰😨😱🥺
